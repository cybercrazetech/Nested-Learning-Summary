# Nested Learning Summary

This repository collects study notes and runnable sketches about the research paper **"Nested Learning: The Illusion of Deep Learning Architectures"** and the accompanying Google Research blog post on continual learning. It contains:

- A concise overview of the Nested Learning (NL) paradigm.
- A breakdown of experimental highlights and the HOPE architecture introduced in the paper.
- Minimal PyTorch-style code to illustrate how nested optimization levels can be implemented.

See `notes/overview.md` for the detailed write-up and `examples/nested_learning.py` for the code sketch.
